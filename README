This repository contains a client written in rust to interact with [vinyldns]

It will include both a library with a `Client` struct for use in other code, as well
as a binary offering a simple cli for calling the api.

[vinyldns]: http://vinyldns.io/


Development
---
The cli tool can be built with

	cargo build

and run with

	cargo run -- <flags here>

See [vinyldns] docs for getting the api started, usually at `http://localhost:9000`.
My own sanity test so far has been running the following commands (todo: integration test?)

	export VINYLDNS_HOST="http://localhost:9000"
	export VINYLDNS_ACCESS_KEY=testUserAccessKey
	export VINYLDNS_SECRET_KEY=testUserSecretKey
	cargo run -- create-group --name testgroup --email test@example.com
	cargo run -- list-groups

grab the group id from one of the previous commands

	cargo run -- create-zone --name ok. --email test@example.com --admin-group-id <group-id>
	cargo run -- list-zones

try also running 

	cargo run -- -h
	cargo run -- <subcommand> -h

to get some examples
